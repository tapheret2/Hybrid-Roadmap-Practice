## 📚 How to Learn

1. **Read THEORY** - Understand core concepts
2. **Run CODE SAMPLES** - See how to apply
3. **Do EXERCISES** - Code without looking at samples
4. **Explain** - Teach someone else or write notes

> 💡 **Tip**: Complete 1 lesson per day, alternating SE and DS to maintain both skills.
